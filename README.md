The project challenge is that the manager at the bank is disturbed with more customers leaving their credit card services. In the model I choose "accuracy" as my metrics and I run different Machine learning models to gett the best fit model which is RandomForestClassifier() model.

This dataset consists of 10,127 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are about 22 features.
